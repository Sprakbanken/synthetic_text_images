# Synthetic text images for North, South, Lule and Inari Sámi
This dataset contains synthetic line images meant for fitting OCR models for North, South, Lule and Inari Sámi.
Clean line images are created using Pillow and they are subsequently distorted using Augraphy [[1]].

## Text sources
The text in this dataset comes from [Giellatekno]'s corpus. Specifically, we used the data files of the `converted/`-directories of [[2]][[3]][[4]][[5]] (commit hashes `{{ sma_hash }}`, `{{ sme_hash }}`, `{{ smj_hash }}`, `{{ smn_hash }}`).

## Splits
The dataset is split randomly by file so {{ train_perc }} % of the files ({{ train_lines }} lines) are in the training split, {{ val_perc }} % of the files ({{ val_lines }} lines) are in the validation split and {{ test_perc }} % of the files ({{ test_lines }} lines) are in the test split.
Each split has a unique set of typefaces and text/background colors.

## Language distribution
The language distribution for the different languages are

| Language Code |       Num train lines |       Num val lines |       Num test lines |
|---------------|-----------------------|---------------------|----------------------|
| sma           | {{ sma_train_lines }} | {{ sma_val_lines }} | {{ sma_test_lines }} |
| sme           | {{ sme_train_lines }} | {{ sme_val_lines }} | {{ sme_test_lines }} |
| smj           | {{ smj_train_lines }} | {{ smj_val_lines }} | {{ smj_test_lines }} |
| smn           | {{ smn_train_lines }} | {{ smn_val_lines }} | {{ smn_test_lines }} |

## Code
The code to create this dataset is available on our [GitHub Repo] (commit hash {{ repo_hash }}).
