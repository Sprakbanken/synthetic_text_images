# Synthetic text images for {{ language }}
This dataset contains synthetic line images meant for fitting OCR models for {{ language }}.
Clean line images are created using Pillow and they are subsequently distorted using Augraphy [[1]].

## Text sources
The text in this dataset comes from [Giellatekno]'s corpus. Specifically, we used the data files of the `converted/`-directory of [[2]] (commit hash {{ corpus_hash }}).

## Splits
The dataset is split randomly by file so {{ train_perc }} % of the files ({{ train_lines }} lines) are in the training split, {{ val_perc }} % of the files ({{ val_lines }} lines) are in the validation split and {{ test_prec }} % of the files ({{ test_lines }} lines) are in the test split.
Each split has a unique set of typefaces and text/background colors.

## Code
The code to create this dataset is available on our [GitHub Repo] (commit hash {{ repo_hash }}).
